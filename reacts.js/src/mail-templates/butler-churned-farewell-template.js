module.exports = `Hi @churned_butler_name@,

Sorry to see you leave but thank you for all your work with us!

We'll organise with your clients to let them know your last day is @butler_last_date@, and that you're leaving due to @churn_reason@, and organise a new butler for them.

Please also advise which of these dropped clients you currently hold keys for and return these keys to their addresses at your earliest convenience.


As the final part of completing your exit from our platform, we require you to complete the following survey (under 5 minutes): https://docs.google.com/forms/u/1/d/1MA6_6UV-lhgpToV86YVA08wdOP3rujBnwBfC3laUqH0/edit

Thanks,
Backend Team`;
