module.exports = `Hi @client_name@,

Hope you’re well!

As your butler @@churned_butler_name@@ may have advised, unfortunately he will be taking a temporary break from our platform starting on @churn_Date@.

@@churned_butler_name@@ will be returning on @return_Date@ and will be able to resume your service then.

To keep the service running smoothly for you, we’ll organise for a terrific substitute butler to take over in the interim – we’ll default to visiting on @next_visit_date@ at @next_visit_time@, but do advise if there are a better time and day that would work for you for this visit.

We’ll also coordinate with @@churned_butler_name@@ to return any keys to you.

We appreciate your understanding.

Backend Team`;
