module.exports = `Hi @butler_name@,

Congratulations! We were impressed by your application and have added you to the list of butlers awaiting their trial visit!

<b>In terms of next steps:</b>

• <b>Start applying for visits:</b> You can now select visits you would like to take inside the app (by following the login link below). We’ll confirm which visits you’ve been successful applying for as soon as possible, and will also send you a message as whenever we have new visits available in the area that match your preferences.

• <b>Let us know if you want us to assign you more work:</b> You can also opt in to let us manage your schedule. This means we will assign you visits automatically if you get good reviews from your clients.

• <b>Set up your payments:</b> You can now also set up your payments (see more instructions on this below). It’s extremely important that you supply the correct documentation in the correct format so that we can pay you promptly.

• <b>Ask us any questions:</b> We know there's a lot of information to take in - Please complete our guide and help materials in case you have any questions at <a href="https://butler.getjarvis.com.au/1/help">https://butler.getjarvis.com.au/1/help</a>. If that is not enough feel free to message us any questions via chat or email inside the app. 
<b>How to maximise your chances of getting visits : </b>

• <b>Provide cleaning equipment:</b> Please make sure you have let us know if you are willing to provide cleaning equipment (mop and/or vacuum) - we prioritise people who can supply equipment, and will be able to offer you a trial visit earlier.

• <b>Provide a reference:</b> If you haven’t supplied us with a reference already, please do so. We’d always love to hear from any former employers. We’re particularly interested to hear if you’ve worked with another cleaning platform like TidyMe, Absolute Domestics or Airtasker, but we’d also love to speak with any other private employers as well.

• <b>Respond quickly:</b> When we have visits available for trials we will message all of our applicants, and will typically assign the visits to those applicants who respond quickest.

• <b>Do a great job!</b> We assign more work to our top performing cleaners so do your best!

Finally, please remember to check-in to all jobs by 6pm the night before your visit. This will confirm to us that you will attend, and enable us to ensure we charge the client and pay you properly for the job.

Thanks and we’re excited to start working with you soon!`
