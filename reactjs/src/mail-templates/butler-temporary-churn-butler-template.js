Hi @churned_butler_name@,

Thanks for letting us know!

We’ll organise with your clients to let them know that you’re leaving after @churn_Date@, and that you’ll be returning on @return_Date@. We’ll let them know you’ll be away due to @churn_reason@ and organise a substitute butler for them in the interim.

Thanks,
Backend Team`;
